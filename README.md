## Welcome to my blog!

Welcome to my blog! You can find most of my writings here. If you want to create your own website using this one as a template, I am still working on making it more intuitive overall.

Feel free to create an issue if something's confusing and I will try to help you out.


## Details about this project
- Most of this was coded during the Christmas vacation of 2022
- Using Next.js + MDX
- I've tried to keep the codebase as modular as possible - PRs are welcome
