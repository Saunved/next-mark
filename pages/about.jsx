                I write stories and articles about a wide variety of topics, ranging from personal experiences, to fictional worlds, or often times, a mix of both. I am a software engineer by profession, so I occasionally write tech guides or articles pertaining to programming.

                By subscribing to my website, you can help me grow an independent blog that is free from the constraints and whims of any publishing platform.
            </p>

                I am also figuring out a way to make the underlying code of this website open-source (i.e. public, and free to use), so that other developers can reuse it to create their own website.
