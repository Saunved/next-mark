Hey there! I am Saunved. 

I love writing and reading in my free time. Some of my favorite books include The Lord of the Rings series, The Fountainhead, And Then There Were None, To Kill A Mockingbird, and the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. I also work as a software engineer over at [Helpshift](https://helpshift.com), Pune. 

You can talk to me about technology, movies, pets, running, coffee, books, and food.

## About this site

A large part of the reason behind creating this website is the joy of coding it from the ground up.

This website is created using a framework called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)  for the styling. I write the content in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).


The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://githib.com) and is connected to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployments. I am also using [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) for creating a subscriber list for this website's newsletter.

Besides the few hours I have spent building it (maybe 25-30 hours), and the cost of my domain, this setup is entirely free (so far). I am hoping to make certain parts of this site open-source so that other developers can use it to create their own blogs with ease.
