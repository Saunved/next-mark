I recently met my friend/mentor for lunch. While discussing things I could work upon, he casually mentioned that I tend to not express my opinions much, and it's high time that I did.

I've never been shy of giving solicited opinions. In fact, if I'm asked something point blank, I can be quite direct. The part that I struggle with is giving unsolicited opinions.

I also tend to refrain from having strong opinions because I've realized that they lead to controversy and lack substance when prodded. I like nuance and subtlety, because the truth can be subjective and we're often blinded by biases.

That being said, I think it will help me grow as a person if I laid down a few opinions that I have. These are things that nobody will ask me directly, but I do feel strongly about. 

I'll cover just five.
## 1. The entire self-help industry is a sham.
Alright, maybe not the entire industry. However, there's a lot to be said about applying generic solutions to specific problems. Self-help can act as a temporary motivator, but it will never actually solve anything for you.

## 2. Don't follow your gut instinct if you want long-term success.
Oh boy! The infamous gut instinct. It's great when it works, and it's horrible when it doesn't. I used to think my gut instinct is great, but when it comes to problems that require deep, deliberate thought, gut instinct is often misleading.

## 3. What you know is secondary to who you know.
This one is pretty obvious. We've all wondered why some person was in an important position despite there being better candidates.

## 4. We shouldn't pay income tax.
The ROI on taxes is terrible.

- Horrible roads; potholes open up every season, even on highways.
- Poor infrastructure, with buildings and hoardings falling on people and even killing them.
- Public transport is just terrible.
- Rampant corruption and nepotism. Doesn't matter what the party is.
- Public education is in shambles.
- Support and help for disabled people is ridiculously bad. How many people have you seen in wheelchairs out on the road in our country?
- A lot of money is used to fund protests, line voters pockets, and create discord for the purpose of vote manipulation.
- Obvious media manipulation and messaging.

Glorifying the nation and making people feel great about it isn't the same as actually making the country great. The voters know what's up.

This is just the tip of the iceberg.

These are problems with every government and party, and honestly, they don't deserve to get a cut of our income for the kind of shambolic work they do.

## 5. It's easy to confuse the noise of one person as the opinion of the majority.
