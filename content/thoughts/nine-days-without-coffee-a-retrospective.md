## Day 0

I have my usual cup of coffee in the morning before leaving for office. In the evening I am attending a play. I forget to drink the second cup.

At 9pm‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääduring the intermission, I am standing outside the theater hall with a heavy head and a foggy mind, wondering what‚Äôs wrong with me.

While riding back home in a disoriented state, I realize I haven‚Äôt had coffee in the evening.

I have been drinking coffee twice a day for seven years. I clearly have a caffeine-dependency. It‚Äôs time to find out how long I can go without it.

## Day 1

It‚Äôs Wednesday. I rush to the office. I am not drinking any coffee today. I want to see what happens. I am fine for most of the day. In the evening I go to play football.

I end up crashing much earlier than usual due to the exhaustion from the game and lack of caffeine in my body.

## Day 2

Thursday is difficult. I have sore muscles and my legs hurt. I can‚Äôt use coffee as a pick-me-up. I resort to some green tea with mild amounts of caffeine in it. I am cautious about how much I have. As long as it‚Äôs a small cup, I should be fine.

My acidity seems to have reduced. Things are not as bad if I don‚Äôt eat something immediately.

I look up coffee withdrawal symptoms. _Headaches, nausea, muscle pain, difficulty concentrating, tiredness._ I am in for a ride it seems.

## Day 3

It‚Äôs Friday, so lots of people at the office, and lots of meetings. I am able to pay attention for the most part, but I resort to drinking some tea. It‚Äôs my only respite in this coffee-less world.

In the evening I replace coffee with a 15-minute nap. I sleep like a baby. It‚Äôs beautiful.

I think to myself, ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt so bad.‚Äù¬†  
Little do I know.

## Day 4

Day 4 is the worst of them all. It‚Äôs a weekend, and I am left alone with my coffee-deprived thoughts. My body hurts _a lot._ I am not sure if it‚Äôs a side effect of lack of caffeine or just the football. Why would it hurt so much after two days though?

I spend the entire day drifting in and out of sleep like a sick person, waking up to eat or read a book, or hang out with my flatmate to watch some T.V.

My dreams seem to be more vivid and pronounced. I am also sleeping lightly, waking up every now and then with a dying flicker of a nightmare in my mind.

## Day 5

Sunday is weird. The body pain has subsided, but I still want to sleep a lot. I try to keep my mind off coffee, and other things in general.

I spend most of the day battling relatively sad thoughts and getting annoyed at things I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been mad at if I had some coffee.

I also take naps. Three good naps of 20 minutes each. I am getting good at this nap thing.

The night ends with me eating an entire bar of dark chocolate (yes, dark chocolate contains some caffeine).

## Day 6

Monday.

The first two hours of the morning are horrible. I am barely awake. I try to keep my wits about me. My eyes are heavy and I feel like I am living in a fog. An hour into work, I walk over to the coffee counter in the office and watch a colleague make her coffee.

I am jealous. I want coffee too. It‚Äôs not fair.

I resort to half a cup of tea, and then another half cup. _Not as much caffeine, I should be fine,_ I whisper to myself.

As the day progresses, the irritability and annoyance dips a bit. In the evening, I get home and crash for 20 minutes. The sleep works wonders, but the day was _horrible._

## Day 7

Tuesday again. I made it to 1 week! My flatmate makes a cup of coffee for himself. I don‚Äôt feel bad. There is a caffeine-free tea we have. I drink that. It tastes pretty good.

I am able to focus for the most part, and the day is super hectic. I don‚Äôt have time to get tired. I also don‚Äôt get acidic when I have a late lunch. The coffee was definitely causing a lot of acidity.

In the evening I take a nap again. I am surprised that I can actually wake up in just about 20 minutes on my naps. Usually when I ‚Äúnap‚Äù, I‚Äôm out for 2 hours.

## Day 8

I don‚Äôt feel weird in the morning. It‚Äôs a good day overall. I am able to focus properly, I am not annoyed. I tease my brain by sniffing a jar of coffee, but I don‚Äôt feel any cravings.

In the evening I exercise for a bit. I don‚Äôt feel like napping today. I am doing alright. I am also less anxious and more relaxed. Is it still placebo if I have been feeling like this for the last few days?

I sleep at almost 1am, feeling relatively normal.

## Day 9

I wake up fresh. I don‚Äôt look at the jar of coffee on the kitchen counter. I make myself an omelette and some toast and spend the morning reading something.

A few hours later, I get up to have the caffeine-free tea as a break.

I feel like I am free to choose _when_ I want to have coffee. Maybe I will just use it as a hack for when I truly need to stay awake rather than as the default for ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù.

It feels good to be here. It definitely wasn‚Äôt easy and I had many opportunities to mess up. I think I got lucky that I didn‚Äôt have splitting headaches. Brain fog, droopy eyes, and muscle pain were the worst part of the entire process.

I also pretty much quit coffee cold turkey. I think that‚Äôs the way I like to take up challenges. I don‚Äôt know if it will work for everyone, but the process is worth living through. I learned how little in control of my coffee cravings I truly was and how much effort it took to be mindful of it.

Do you have a coffee or tea dependency? Would you be willing to try going 9 days without it?
