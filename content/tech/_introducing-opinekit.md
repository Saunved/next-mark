OpineKit is an AI-driven blog engagement toolkit.
Its goal is to help your readers engage more meaningfully with your posts.

## The why
I love indie blogs. They are the lifeline of a diverse internet, perhaps the cornerstone of a *healthy* internet.

It takes motivation to keep up a blog. It takes consistency to build a community, and it becomes hard to engage with audiences in a centralized fashion when you're running your own setup. Sometimes we talk to our readers on Reddit, on Twitter, on HackerNews, on LinkedIn, or maybe even Discord. Opinions are lost because of the friction that is introduced. 

Discussions that never happened. 
People you never interacted with. 

The act of putting what you're thinking out there deserves better.

## Trodden paths
The blogger who seeks more often goes down the path of attempting to add "likes", or if they're fancy - then a comments section to their site. If you've ever run a WordPress blog, you know the pain of dealing with spam comments. Comment boxes are drab. After laboring through a post, they offer the reader the worst possible thing they could've asked for - a blank editor with a blinking cursor.
No, thank you.

This is also the reason why many blogs prefer not having a comments section in the first place. Who needs the hassle?

## The how
What's the solution?

Engaging with content shouldn't feel like a chore or an obligation.
OpineKit attempts to engage your readers through play, and some AI magic.

The first step is asking your reader *specific* yes/no opinions about what they just read. 
Genuine, thought-provoking opinions.
The second step... is to ask more. 
Anonymously.
No friction.

Once they've answered a few questions, OpineKit analyses their answers, and comes up with a discussion topic they might be interested in.
Something they can write to engage with you one on one.
And then it does just that - it asks them.

Now - everything after this point onwards is a bonus.
Maybe they will type something.
Maybe they will submit it.
And maybe you can have a conversation with them about it.
OpineKit's goal isn't to force it. The goal is to help readers connect better with your content.

## And more
- OpineKit summarizes your post. 
- If a user signs up or logs in to OpineKit on your website, OpineKit shows them as *your* subscriber in *your* dashboard and allows you to export their email ID. Your user, your data. Each subscriber we convert for you is direct validation that OpineKit works.
- OpineKit allows people to share links to summaries, polls, and discussions, all while staying embedded in your website.
- OpineKit never sends your users marketing emails.
- And most importantly, it does not store any third-party cookies. None of that nasty stuff, thank you very much.

## What's next?
OpineKit is currently in alpha. You can check out the demo below this post. I have made this tool with indie bloggers in mind, and will try my best to price it accordingly.

If you'd like to be a part of the closed beta or you're curious about pricing, please sign up for the [OpineKit waitlist](https://opinekit.com). I plan to launch soon, after my glorious alpha testers provide valuable feedback. Yes, there will be a free trial.

Until then, you can explore my website as a demo for OpineKit. If you have feedback for me, just scroll down on this post, and leave it right there. I promise I will try to respond.
