## Saunved's blog

I am *not* a YouTuber, podcaster, or famous author. At least not yet.

I don't aspire to be the first two, but I definitely want to finish my book one day and have it knock your socks off.

I coded this blog from scratch because I got tired of working around the constraints (and whims) of different blogging platforms and frameworks. I hope to make this setup generic and open-source it one day.

If you're into reading captivating short stories, you like tech, or (for some weird reason), you
appreciate free-style poetry - you've landed in the right place.

You can find out more about me [[about|here]], or continue reading below.
