Such vivid important things  
Laid out over the tapestry of screens and tapes  
Every moment in human history  
Laid out in great detail  

And we make this our history  
And it is no longer a mystery  
If there is a book  
Or a song  
That explains  
Why things are  
The way they are

And you go further back  
Further, further back in time  
You dig up the fossils  
And you start finding the oil mines  
And we scavenge for the answers  
Puzzles left to solve for us  
By the river of time

Do you realise  
For a moment  
That from this century onwards    
Whatever we do  
Will be so well documented  
The events won't be a mystery  
It will all be out there to find

What a pity  
To not realise we come from obscurity  
That there is a valley of time  
Far deeper than we can fathom  
That we travelled from  
For millenia  
Carrying all that we ever really needed  
In the fabric of our very selves  
Passing on knowledge  
One generation at a time  
Until this one century  
When everything suddenly became  
Memorable.
