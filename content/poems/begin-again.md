Search inside your tired soul,  
Do you find a lie, can you make it whole?  
Suck my life out, right out of me,  
Make me darker, make me cold.

Shrouded in veils, of fortunes and deaths,  
A past tainted by innocent mistakes  
Uncorrected;  
Those rivers flowed into the sea  
An ocean of mistakes,  
Can't humanity see?

Sent the soldiers to die,  
And a man on the moon,  
To tell us we can believe,  
In our future;  
Past doomed.  

Does hope lie?  
Or does hope lie in something,  
Anything.  
Tell me.  
If we have a moment to ourselves,  
Will we stop to really think?  

Search inside your tired soul.  
Do you find a lie, can you make it whole?  
Suck my life out, right out of me,  
Make me darker, make me cold.  

And when the sun rises,  
Birds dead, and long gone,  
Chirrups of intelligent;  
dead robots lighting up the dawn,  
Don't look at me for help.  
Look at humanity  
And ask them.  
Beg.  
Plead.  

And when they refuse,  
Press that button.  
Let's begin again,  
Shall we?
