description: "Poems I have written over the years."

For some reason, most of the poems I write tend to exhibit some sort of dark or negative emotion. I believe it could be because that's an outlet for my brain - a way to deal with negativity.

I will continue adding my older poems to this list over time, and hopefully also categorize them better.
