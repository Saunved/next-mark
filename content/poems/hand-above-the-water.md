⚠️ Trigger warning: su\*c\*de

* * *

She puts a hand out;  
Out of the water,  
Takes a deep breath -  
Lungs fill with fire  

Hand above,  
Just her hand above the water

Her soul collides,  
Fire and ice,  
Confusion reigns  
Life and death entwined

It's dark out tonight,  
Nobody; no light,  
Frozen lake,  
in the middle of summer

She sputters; and the water takes hold,  
Strangling the remnants of her dying soul,  
Flashes of the past,  
Nostalgia at last,  
She feels for a change,  
Although the change won't last

Her hand above,  
Is now forever gone,  
She'll be forgotten in a few years,  
Her memories; long gone.

Just another soul,  
In the middle of a war,  
Just another life.

We'll move on.

I think I wrote this back in the day because I read about a student's suicide, and it affected me how we just forget and move on as a society.
