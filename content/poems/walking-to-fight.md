Soft, gentle music plays,  
Temptations that we always had,  
Falling behind, one breath at a time,  
When we're walking, walking,  
Walking to fight. 

There's no knowledge of what truly lies ahead,  
A "wonderful" world, I wonder what it says,  
Asking, asking a little too much,  
And we're walking, walking,  
Walking to fight. 

Contradicting, every promise made,  
Finding beauty in knowledge unsaid,  
Redefining old ways,  
Controlling what's right,  
And we're walking, walking,   
Walking to fight. 

A cause, a reason,  
Maybe treason,  
Not the same...  
Every soul,  
believer,  
Unbeliever,   
Insane?  
They're hoping to see, some dark,  
Some light,  
They're walking, walking,  
Walking to fight.  

The dreams that we had,   
Regrets that softly died,   
And we're walking walking,  
Walking to fight.  
We're falling, falling,  
Falling to rise.
